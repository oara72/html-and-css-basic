		<h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>

		<article>
			<p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was 
			born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of 
			mathematics, <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
			and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most 
			prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books</em> and 
			papers. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>

			<p>He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's 
			work, Introduction in <cite>analysin 
			infinitorum (1748)</cite>, remained a standard textbook in the field for 
			well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote 
			Lettres &#224; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772), giving a clear 
			non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the 
			time.</p>

			<p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying Euler. 
			Notations still in use today, such as e and &#960;, were introduced 
			in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind 
			a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals 
			of mathematics.</p> <br /> <br />

		<h1>The Most Beautiful Theorem ?</h1>

		<p>Euler's Equation</p>

		<p>cos(<var>x</var>) + <var>i</var>sin(x) = <var>e</var> <sup><var>(ix) </var></sup></p>

		<p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, 
		and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive
		the identity</p>

		<p><var>e<sup>(&#960;i)</sup></var> + 1 = 0</p>

		<p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &#960;, e, and i in
		a single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers 
		conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> magazine named 
		Euler's Identity as the 
		most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.</p>
